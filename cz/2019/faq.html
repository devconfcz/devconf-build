	<div class="toggle">
        <a href="#" class="toggle-title"><strong>Q: Are the talks recorded or live-streamed?</strong><i class="fa fa-plus"></i></a>
        <div class="toggle-content"><p>We intend to record and post as many of the talks as possible.  Occasionally a speaker’s talk is not able to be recorded for content or technical reasons.  The talks will be posted on our YouTube channel as soon as they are ready.</p>
	<p>We are still working out whether it will be possible to live-stream talks this year.  The University facility we use is making some infrastructure changes that may prevent this.

        <a href="#" class="toggle-title"><strong>Q: Will I be able to get something to eat at the conference?</strong><i class="fa fa-plus"></i></a>
        <div class="toggle-content"><p>We have arranged to have 5 food trucks present on site. All of them are planning to offer vegan or vegetarian options in addition to their regular choices. We are going to have tents near the food trucks so that people have places to eat if it is raining. Please be aware that it is Winter in January/February in Brno and you should check the weather forecast and dress appropriately.</p>

	<h2 id="around">Getting around Brno and to DevConf</h2>
	<div class="toggle">
        <a href="#" class="toggle-title"><strong>Q: Is there public transportation?</strong><i class="fa fa-plus"></i></a>
        <div class="toggle-content"><p>Public transportation in Brno is provided by <a href="http://www.dpmb.cz/default.aspx">DPMB</a> which provides tram lines, trolley-bus lines and bus lines. At night all public transportation is provided by night bus lines.</p>
	</div>
	</div>

	<div class="toggle">
        <a href="#" class="toggle-title"><strong>Q: Do I need a ticket to use the bus or tram?</strong><i class="fa fa-plus"></i></a>
        <div class="toggle-content"><p>YES! If you want to use public transportation, you must buy a ticket <strong>before you board</strong> the bus, tram or trolleybus. You need to purchase a two-zone ticket for zones 100+101 for any stop in the city of Brno. Single journey tickets can be bought from machines (coins only at most with a few, including those at the main station able to take credit cards) at many stops, or in Tabak stores.</p>
	<p>You <strong>need to validate</strong> the single journey ticket in the Yellow validation machine when you enter the bus, tram or trolleybus. Instructions how to pay for transportation in Brno can be found <a href="http://www.dpmb.cz/Default.aspx">here</a>.</p>
	<p>The DPMB also offers <a href="http://www.dpmb.cz/Default.aspx?seo=sms-jizdenky">sms tickets</a>. This service is only available for Czech SIM cards. To use the service, send a message with a code to 90206. The code for a 75-minute ticket (CZK 29) is BRNO. The code, BRNOD, is for an all-day ticket (CZK 99). After sending the message, you will receive a ticket via SMS within a few minutes.</p>
	<p>If you are staying in Brno for several days, consider buying a 5-day ticket which costs 250 CZK. There are several places where you can buy this ticket, but the easiest one is probably the main train station. You can buy it at any counter (look for the international counters because they are more likely to speak English). When you first use your ticket, be sure to validate it. You only have to validate your ticket one time.</p>

	<div class="toggle">
        <a href="#" class="toggle-title"><strong>Q: Are there taxis?</strong><i class="fa fa-plus"></i></a>
        <div class="toggle-content"><p>We recommend downloading the <a href="https://www.liftago.com/">Liftago</a> app to book a taxi electronically. It is also possible to reserve a taxi using your mobile phone, but usually you will need to be able to speak Czech to use phone based services.</p>

	<div class="toggle">
        <a href="#" class="toggle-title"><strong>Q: How do I get to the Venue?</strong><i class="fa fa-plus"></i></a>
        <div class="toggle-content"><p><strong>From the main train station</strong> take tram No.1 (towards Řečkovice). Get off at the stop Semilasso (after approximately 15 minutes). Take the street on the right, Metodějova. After approximately 200 meters take the first street on the right, Božetěchova. Continue straight approximately 100 m. The building on your left hand side is the university.</p>
	<p><strong>From the main bus station (Zvonařka)</strong> take bus No. 44 or 67. Get off at the stop "Semilasso". Follow the street for 100 m and then take the street on the right, Božetěchova. After approximately 400 meters you will arrive to the building of the university.</p>
	<p><strong>From the Red Hat Offices</strong> tram stop (Červinkova for Purkynova 71/99 FBC office or Technologický park for TPB office) take tram No. 12 towards Komárov. Get off at the stop Skácelova (first stop from Červinkova, third from Technologický park). Take bus No. 30 or 84 or 53 from the bus stop at the corner diagonally opposite the tram stop you exited at. From both buses, get off at the Semilasso stop.</p>

	<h2 id="schedule">Schedule/CfP Questions</h2>
        <div class="toggle">
        <a href="#" class="toggle-title"><strong>Q: Where is the schedule? When will the Schedule be ready?</strong><i class="fa fa-plus"></i></a>
        <div class="toggle-content"><p>We hope to release the schedule around 10 December 2018.  We are currently confirming the order of tracks with our track captains, waiting on confirmations from speakers that they will be able to attend and filling in the gaps, holes and other “wiggly bits” in the schedule.</p>
	<p>We are planning to start at 9am on 25 January 2019 and end at 4pm on 27 January 2019.  These time may change slightly, so do watch for the final schedule.</p>
	</div>
	</div>

        <div class="toggle">
        <a href="#" class="toggle-title"><strong>Q: It’s after the deadline and I haven’t received an acceptance notification.  What do I do?</strong><i class="fa fa-plus"></i></a>
        <div class="toggle-content"><p>We received an amazingly large number of high quality submissions.  Our track teams that review the talks have had to work a lot to read and decide on them all.  We have sent out the first round of acceptances around 26 November 2018.  We are finalizing some issues around scheduling and room availability along with filling out the last slots.</p>
	<p>If you haven’t received an acceptance yet, your talk isn’t necessarily rejected.  We expect to send out the second round once we have received accepts and declines back from speakers in round 1 so we can most flexibly complete the schedule.  This should late during the first week of December.</p>
	<p>We have no further information available at this time.</p>

	<div class="toggle">
        <a href="#" class="toggle-title"><strong>Q: My talk was accepted but I can’t physically come, what can I do?</strong><i class="fa fa-plus"></i></a>
        <div class="toggle-content"><p>Please email us at <a href="mailto:info@devconf.cz">info@devconf.cz</a> and explain your situation and what your suggestion is.  We can, on a case-by-case basis allow alternative speakers, however this is not guaranteed.  We generally do not allow for remote presentations, however you are welcome to email us and explain why you think your talk should be an exception.</p>

	<h2 id="registration">Registration Questions</h2>
        <div class="toggle">
        <a href="#" class="toggle-title"><strong>Q: How much does it cost to attend DevConf.cz?  Do I need to register?</strong><i class="fa fa-plus"></i></a>
        <div class="toggle-content"><p>Admission to DevConf.cz is free and only requires that you register for a free ticket.  Register on-line <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/devconfcz-2019-tickets-53807645115" target="_blank">here</a>. Capacity is limited!</p>
	<p>Onsite (at venue) registration is possible, even after on-line registration has closed, but it will also be limited capacity. You are strongly encouraged to register online to ensure you have a ticket.</p>
	</div>
	</div>

	<div class="toggle">
        <a href="#" class="toggle-title"><strong>Q: If the conference is free, why do I have to register?</strong><i class="fa fa-plus"></i></a>
        <div class="toggle-content"><p>We use registration to manage several logistics issues around DevConf.cz, amongst other things.  For example, we have to ensure that we do not exceed the maximum number of people allowed in the building by the fire marshall.  We also use the data for things like estimating the number of food trucks to invite and planning for various parts of the conference.</p>
	<p>Because we have typically attracted over 1500 people each year, we have learned to do registration to minimize the possibility that someone will show up to the conference and then have to be turned away.</p>
	</div>
	</div>

	<div class="toggle">
        <a href="#" class="toggle-title"><strong>Q: Can I register on-site?</strong><i class="fa fa-plus"></i></a>
        <div class="toggle-content"><p>There are a small number of tickets reserved for on-site registration.  On-site registration is identical to internet registration in terms of cost (free!) and in terms of what information is asked for.  You are <strong>strongly</strong> encouraged to register online when we open online registration to both save time when you arrive and to prevent you from being turned away because we are at capacity.</p>

        <div class="toggle-content"><p>Trains to/from Prague or to/from Vienna (Breclav) are not stopping at the main train station. Instead they are making two stops, one at Brno-Zidenice and one at Brno dolni nadrazi. This affects both Czech Rail (CD) and RegioJet (RJ) trains.</p>
	<p>You can choose either station. Transportation to the city center (Brno Hlavni Nadrazi) is different depending on which station you choose:</p>
	<ul>
            <li>Brno-Zidenice: You can move between the city center (Brno Hlavni Nadrazi) and Brno-Zidenice by train using any train making the trip. These trains are typically signed: S3, S33, S2, S6, R8, R12, R19, and R56. Your Czech Rail (CD) ticket is valid for these trains. If you are using RegioJet please contact the company for validity details.</li>
            <li>Brno dolni nadrazi: You can move between the city center (Brno Hlavni Nadrazi) and Brno dolni nadrazi by bus number 61. Your Czech Rail (CD) ticket is valid for these trains. If you are using RegioJet please contact the company for validity details.</li>
        </ul>
	<p>Note: Your Czech Rail ticket does not, generally, allow you to use any public transportation beyond the main train station and you should get a proper valid onward transportation ticket from the ticket machine or a ticket window/tabak/kiosk. The ticket machines at the main train station accept credit cards.</p>
	<p>For more information, please see this <a href="https://www.idsjmk.cz/kestazeni/VVVB2018en.pdf">brochure</a> and this <a href="/files/brno-main-train-station.jpg">sign</a>.</p>

        <div class="toggle-content"><p>The concept of the badge flair contest started at <a href="http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/prague/2018/badge-flair/">Write the Docs</a>, a conference and community for documentation-oriented tech folks who love to start fun and light-hearted traditions. The idea is simple: Decorate your badge, tweet a picture, and you might win a prize!</p>

	<div class="toggle">
        <a href="#" class="toggle-title"><strong>Q: Who can participate? Do I have to participate?</strong><i class="fa fa-plus"></i></a>
        <div class="toggle-content"><p>All conference attendees, speakers, and volunteers are eligible to participate. Organizers cannot enter the contest, although we do encourage you to lead by example and spread the word.</p>
          <p><b>The contest is optional.</b> Of course, you are free to use the decorating station even if you don’t want to participate, and decorate your badge for your own enjoyment!</p>

        <div class="toggle-content">
          <p>During the conference, we will have a decorating station in building D (in front of rooms D0206 and D0207) with all kinds of stickers. Choose your favorite stickers and decorate your badge however you want.</p>
          <p>Tweet a picture of your badge before <b>Saturday at 18:00</b>, using both hashtags <b>#devconfcz</b> and <b>#devconfbadge</b>. If you do not have a Twitter account, you may ask a friend to tweet the picture for you; the prize will be given to the owner of the badge itself.</p>
          <p>The judges will choose a winner, and the MC will announce it at the <a href="https://devconfcz2019.sched.com/event/KIbw/wrap-up-and-win-win-win">wrap-up session</a> on <b>Sunday at 15:30</b>. There might be an honorary mention as well.</p>
          <p><b>The winner must be in the room at the time of the announcement.</b> If they are not present, the prize will go to the runner-up. Follow the <a href="https://twitter.com/devconf_cz">DevConf CZ</a> Twitter account to stay updated with room announcements and other contest updates.</p>

        <p>1. You should not cover any part of your name, but you can cover the DevConf logo or other elements if you don’t need to acces them.</p>
        <p>2. All contest entries must follow the conference Code of Conduct. Do not use any harmful messaging or images in your decorations.</p>
        <p>3. Although you may use your own items for your badge (such as markers or stickers), we value having similar resources for everyone, so if you overdo it with items you brought yourself (such as LED lights or sparkly feathers), you may be disqualified.</p>
