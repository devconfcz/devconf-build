						Please review full eligibility criteria in the <a href='https://forms.gle/bp5PHdyW8V8zhSsW6' target='_blank'>application form</a> and submit your application by 5pm UTC on Thursday, November 21, 2019. If you proposed a session, but would like to attend the conference regardless of whether it’s accepted, you can fill out the form without waiting for the acceptance decisions. We expect to send out most acceptance decisions before November 21, but speakers whose sessions are accepted after November 21 will still have a chance to apply for diversity scholarships.					</div>
