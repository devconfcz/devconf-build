            <h3>Scope of this Privacy Statement</h3>
            <p>
              Red Hat, Inc. and its affiliated companies and subsidiaries involved in organizing DevConf.info
              events globally (collectively, “Red Hat”) respect your privacy. This Privacy Statement applies
              to personal data collected by Red Hat through the devconf.info website, and other websites
              which we operate and on which we post a direct link to this Privacy Statement. For some websites
              managed by Red Hat affiliates, the affiliate may act as a controller for data collected from the
              website. This Privacy Statement may not apply to open source project websites sponsored by Red Hat.
              Such project websites may have their own privacy statements, which we encourage you to review.
            </p>
            <p>
              Please also note that co-branded websites (websites where Red Hat presents content together with one
              or more of our business partners) may be governed by additional or different privacy statements.
              Please refer to the privacy statement on those websites for more information about applicable privacy
              practices.
            </p>
            <p>
              Red Hat’s obligations with respect to personal data that may be held on behalf of customers in
              connection with cloud services Red Hat provides, such as personal data stored by customers using our
              OpenShift Online offering, are defined in our agreements with our customers and are not governed
              by this Privacy Statement.
            </p>
            <p>
              As used in this Privacy Statement, “personal data” means any information relating to an identified
              or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’). An identifiable natural person is one who can be
              identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an
              identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to
              the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural
              person.
            </p>

            <p>
              When you visit our websites we may automatically collect information such as your IP address, browser type and language, operating system, location, date and time. We may also use cookies to collect information as you navigate our websites. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your device.
            </p>

            <p>
              Red Hat uses some cookies that are strictly necessary for the delivery of services on our websites. Cookies that are strictly necessary allow us to improve the safety and security of our websites, authenticate account users, allow you to access your private accounts on our websites, allow you to sign into different portions of our websites with the use of only one login, balance the traffic on our websites, and remember items in your shopping cart. Cookies that are strictly necessary are not used for marketing purposes.
            </p>

            <p>
              Red Hat also uses cookies to improve our service to you and personalize your web browsing experience, such as by gaining a better understanding of your interests and requirements regarding our websites, our business or our products and services. Cookies that Red Hat uses to improve our services and your website experience may remember your language and site preferences, invite you to participate in surveys or evaluations, show you when you are logged into our system and allow you to remain logged-in for a period of time, help provide you with support services, remember your login information, and pre-populate forms that you have already completed.
            </p>

            <p>
              Red Hat also uses cookies that collect information about how you use our websites, including which pages you visit, and whether you experience any errors. These cookies use aggregate information to provide statistics on how our websites are used, help us improve our websites by measuring errors, testing different designs on our websites, and helping us measure the traffic on our websites so that we can optimize our content accordingly. These cookies are used to help us improve how our websites work, understand what interests our users, and measure website quality and the effectiveness of our online advertising.
            </p>

            <p>
              In addition, we may use remarketing technology to advertise on other websites you may visit. In doing so, a third party may place or read a unique ad-serving cookie on your device and use technical information about your browser and your activity at a Red Hat website to serve advertisements to you on non-Red Hat websites.
            </p>

            <p>
              If you do not want your information to be stored by cookies, you can configure your browser so that it always rejects these cookies or asks you each time whether you want to accept them or not. However, you must understand that choosing to reject cookies may reduce the performance and functionality of our websites. Your browser documentation includes instructions explaining how to enable, disable or delete cookies at the browser level (usually located within the “Help”, “Tools” or “Edit” facility). While Red Hat websites at this time generally do not recognize automated browser signals regarding tracking mechanisms, such as “do not track” instructions, you can generally express your privacy preferences regarding the use of most cookies and similar technologies through your web browser.

              Red Hat also uses web beacons alone or in conjunction with cookies to compile information about usage of our websites and interaction with emails from Red Hat (e.g., open rates, click through rates). Web beacons are clear electronic images that can recognize certain types of information on your device, such as cookies, when you viewed a particular website tied to the web beacon, and a description of a website tied to the web beacon. For example, Red Hat may place web beacons in marketing emails that notify Red Hat when you click on a link in the email that directs you to one of our websites. Red Hat uses web beacons to operate and improve our websites and email communications.
